## Analyzing the Stroop Effect

# Background Information

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.

In this project, the following questions regarding the dataset will be answered using popular python Data Analysis and Visualization tools such as pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib and seaborn.   

(1) What is the independent variable? What is the dependent variable?

(2) What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform?

3) Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.
